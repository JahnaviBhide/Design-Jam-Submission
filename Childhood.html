                  <h3><strong>Family Background and Youth in South Africa</strong></h3>
                  <p class = "youth">
                    Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, one of South Africa's three capital cities.
                    His father was an engineer and his mother was a model and nutritionist. 
                    He is the oldest of three children in an ambitious family. 
                    His brother Kimbal Musk is currently a venture capitalist and environmentalist. 
                    His sister Tosca Musk is an award-winning producer and director.
                    After his parents divorced when he was a child, Musk lived primarily with his father.
                    Musk started school a year early, attending the private Waterkloof House Preparatory School and later graduating 
                    from Pretoria Boys High School.
                    He read voraciously and was also an avid fan of comics. Self-described as a bookworm and something of a smart aleck, he was bullied in school and withdrew to his books at the expense of his social life

                  <h3><strong>Bullied</strong></h3>
                  <p class = "youth">
                    Musk’s intellectual aptitude did him few favors as a child. He found few friends in the tough-minded Afrikaner culture he encountered in school.
                    "I had a terrible upbringing. I had a lot of adversity growing up. One thing I worry about with my kids is they don't face enough adversity," he would later say in an interview.
                    Musk attended the English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School, and later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School.19
                    The years were lonely and brutal, from his descriptions.
                    "They got my best friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up. And that hurt,"" Musk said. “For some reason they decided that I was it, and they were going to go after me nonstop. 
                    That’s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the (expletive) out of me, and then I’d come home, and it would just be awful there as well."
                    If there was a point of bright escape for Musk; it was technology. When he was only 10, he became acquainted with programming via the Commodore VIC-20, an inexpensive home computer. Before long, he had become proficient enough to create Blastar — a video game in the style of Space-Invaders. 
                    He sold the BASIC code for the game to a magazine called PC and Office Technology for $500.21
                    In one telling incident at that time, Musk, along with his brother, planned to open a video game arcade near their school. Ultimately, their parents nixed the plan. But apparently the only thing stopping them was the need for a city permit which had to be applied for by an adult.

                  <h3><strong>Moving to Canada</strong></h3>
                  <p class = "youth">
                    At 17, Musk moved to Canada to avoid serving in the South African military, whose main duty in the late 1980s was enforcing apartheid. 
                    He would later obtain Canadian citizenship through his mother.
                    After emigrating to Canada, Musk enrolled in Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. 
                    It was there that he met Justine Wilson, an aspiring writer. They would marry and have five sons together, twins and triplets, before divorcing in 2008.
