                    <p id = "body">After two years at Queen's University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. He took on two majors, but his time there wasn’t all work and no play. With a fellow student, he bought a 10-bedroom fraternity house, which they used as an ad hoc nightclub.
                       Musk graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the Wharton School.The two majors speak to the direction Musk’s career would take later, but it was physics that made the deepest impression on his thinking.
                       "(Physics is) a good framework for thinking,"" he'd later say. "Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there."
                        Musk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University. With the Internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming, Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head. He left the Ph.D. program after just two days.27
                        In 1995, with $28,000 and his younger brother Kimbal at his side, Musk started Zip2, a web software company that would help newspapers develop online city guides. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq’s AltaVista web search engine for a whopping $340 million. 
                        Musk used his Zip2 buyout money to create X.com, which he intended to shape into the future of banking. X was merged with a company called Confinity and the resulting company came to be known as PayPal. Musk was then ousted from the company before it was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion.
                        After PayPal slipped away, Musk helped generate funding for an electric car startup called Tesla.</p>
